### Hello there ðŸ‘‹

You have somehow found this, before you leave, let me introduce myself

### I am a new JavaScript developer 
I specialize in making discord bots usually free of charge if they are simple. Some things should be noted such as I don't host your bot, I will give you the source code of your bot via github and your bots code will be public.  

### Projects
I currently have no public projects mainly because I am new to the coding world.

### contact 

If you wish to make a request, please add me (ThatFlick#1449) on discord and we can discuss in DM'S
