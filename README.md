# Hello there ðŸ‘‹

You have somehow found this before you leave, let me introduce myself.

# I am a new JavaScript developer 
I specialize in making discord bots usually free of charge if they are simple, you can give anything in return if you want to be generous :). Some things should be noted. For example, I won't host your bot, I will give you the source code of your bot via GitHub and your botâ€™s code will be public (No private info will be leaked if there is any.). If you wish to host your bot, I suggest ploxhost because they offer cheap hosting solutions.

# Projects
I currently have no public projects currently

# contact 

If you wish to make a request, please add me (ThatFlick#1449) on discord so we can discuss this in DM'S.
